Class XI General Studies project - Reviving the rivers of India.

## Why?

In the last few decades, rivers in India have undergone a drastic change due to population and development. Through construction of dams, rampant soil erosion, and water pollution, India's water crisis has escalated to a frightnening level. After conducting thorough research and  surveys, we found that the first barrier that needs to be crossed in this road to recovery is the lack of awareness.

## Solution

riviore is a simple android app that helps users look up any river in India through the Google Maps API, and then find information regarding the river which is updated directly by specific government organisations.

There is a donation feature available too through which users can fill a form to donate money directly to institutes working towards reviving the rivers of India.

P.S - This is still a prototype.
